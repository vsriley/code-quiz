# code-quiz

## Description

This project was created to quiz a user and return a score based on the time it takes for them to finish the quiz.
The user can input their initials and look at a high score page that is generated based on scores stored in local storage.
The user can also clear the high score list and restart the quiz to take it again.
This project uses a wide variety of JS tools such as timers and local storage.

The largest difficulty I faced was creating the form to input initials through JS. When I had it on the index.html page, it would 
disappear as soon as someone clicked on it prior to entering their intials. I ended up moving it to the highscores.html page instead 
and from there the high scores list is generated after intials are entered.

## Installation

To utilize the project, open in your internet browser.

## Usage

This project quizzes a user on computer programming and returns a score based on their answers and the time it took for them to finish the quiz.
The user is asked for their initials and a high score list is generated.
