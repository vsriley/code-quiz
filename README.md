# code-quiz

## Description

This project was created to quiz a user and return a score based on the time it takes for them to finish the quiz.
The user can input their initials and look at a high score page that is generated based on scores stored in local storage.
This project uses a wide variety of JS tools such as timers and local storage.

Overall I have been struggling to currently complete this project due to health issues. I have finished the portion that creates the quiz itself and generates their score.
I have yet to complete the part where the user is asked for their initials in a form which is then stored in local storage and displayed with other high scores.
I plan to complete this at a later date. I currently have it pseudocoded.

## Installation

To utilize the project, open in your internet browser.

## Usage

This project quizzes a user on computer programming and returns a score based on their answers and the time it took for them to finish the quiz.
The user is asked for their initials and a high score list is generated.
